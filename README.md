Description:
Our software solves the problem by visualizing the historical data presented, indicating the performance of the company over the years. It then creates a linear regression analysis on the dataset to predict next year's carbon emissions and offsets and again, using historical data, gives indicators on the company's performance as compared to the the past through a normal distribution curve.

Building software:
*Method 1:* Through the drive/collab invite link provided you can directly access the python notebook and execute each code block sequentially.
*Method 2:* From the public repository link, download the notebook and open it within google collab (File -> Open Notebook)

_NOTE_: Ensure that you upload the datasets by dragging and dropping the csv files in the repository.
